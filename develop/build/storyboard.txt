OurBlock Story Board : 
===================================================
What is our block? How it will be useful to my community?

As an association board member, you know the effort goes into send a message across the community like water distribution times, get a feedback from the residents to make decisions and have residents share community problems. Also, as tresurer, imagine the complexity in maintaining the home owner payments and expenses with the receipts. 

At the same time, as a resident, how can you make people aware of communities real problems and share ideas to solve them. How can we get indepth information about our community financials including reserves to get a 360 degree perspective about our community. 

We believe that small and mid level communities should be able to manage themseleves efficiently. Here is our solution.
